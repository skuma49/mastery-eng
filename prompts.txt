I have a JSON file with vocabulary and idiom test responses. I want you to:

Evaluate each question and assign a score out of 10 based on correctness and relevance.
Provide detailed feedback for each question explaining why the score was given and how to improve.
Calculate the overall score out of 10.
Generate a professional report in Excel format with the following columns: Question #, Word/Phrase, User Answer, Score, and Feedback.
Add a summary sheet in the same Excel file showing:

Test details (date, duration, total questions)
Overall score
Strengths
Areas for improvement.**



Ensure the Excel file is well-formatted for readability (bold headers, adjusted column widths, proper alignment).

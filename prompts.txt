I have a JSON file with vocabulary and idiom test responses. I want you to:

Evaluate each question and assign a score out of 10 based on correctness and relevance.
Provide detailed feedback for each question explaining why the score was given and how to improve.
Calculate the overall score out of 10.
Generate a professional report in Excel format with the following columns: Question #, Word/Phrase, User Answer, Score, and Feedback.
Add a summary sheet in the same Excel file showing:

Test details (date, duration, total questions)
Overall score
Strengths
Areas for improvement.**



Ensure the Excel file is well-formatted for readability (bold headers, adjusted column widths, proper alignment).



Evaluate the following vocabulary test response and return the result in this JSON format:

{
  "evaluated_results": [
    {
      "question_id": <question_id>,
      "word_type": "<word_type>",
      "evaluation_criteria": {
        "word_used_correctly": <true/false>,
        "demonstrates_understanding": <true/false>,
        "grammar_correct": <true/false>,
        "creative_usage": <true/false>,
        "overall_score": <numeric score out of 100>,
        "evaluator_comments": "<constructive feedback and suggested improved sentence>"
      }
    }
  ]
}

Scoring Rules:
- `word_used_correctly`: true if the target word is used in the correct context.
- `demonstrates_understanding`: true if the sentence shows understanding of the wordâ€™s meaning.
- `grammar_correct`: true if the sentence is grammatically correct (minor errors allowed if meaning is clear).
- `creative_usage`: true if the usage is creative or original beyond a basic sentence.
- `overall_score`: numeric score out of 100 based on these criteria.
- `evaluator_comments`: include feedback and an improved version of the sentence if needed.
